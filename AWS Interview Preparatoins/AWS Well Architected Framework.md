# AWS Well Architected Framework and its 5 Pillars

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud

### 1. Operational Excellence

#### Design Principles

Perform operations as code
Make frequent, small, reversible changes
Anticipate failure
Learn from all operational failures

### 2. Security- The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security

#### Design Principles

Implement a strong identity foundation
Enable traceability
Apply security at all layers
Automate security best practices
Protect data in transit and at rest
Keep people away from data

### 3. Reliability - The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to.

#### Design Principles

Automatically recover from failure

Stop guessing capacity 

### 4. Performance Efficiency

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements

#### Design Principles

Use serverless architectures

Horizontal Scaling- Upgrading the compute to bigger Instance type 

Vertical Scaling- Increasing no of underlying instances

### 5. Cost Optimization

The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

#### Design Principles

Implement cloud financial management
