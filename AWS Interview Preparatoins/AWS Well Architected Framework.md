# AWS Well Architected Framework and its 5 Pillars

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud

#### Design Principles

Perform operations as code

Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Anticipate failure

Learn from all operational failures

### 2. Security- The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security

#### Design Principles

Implement a strong identity foundation

Enable traceability

Apply security at all layers

Automate security best practices

Protect data in transit and at rest

Keep people away from data

### 3. Reliability - The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to.

Reliability requires that your workload be aware of failures as they occur and take action to avoid impact on availability. Workloads must be able to both withstand failures and automatically repair issues.

#### Design Principles

Automatically recover from failure

Stop guessing capacity 

### 4. Performance Efficiency

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements

#### Design Principles

Use serverless architectures

Vertical Scaling- Upgrading the compute to bigger Instance type

Horizontal Scaling-  Increasing no of underlying instances

### 5. Cost Optimization

The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

#### Design Principles

Implement cloud financial management
